will be available as _mu͒4 symlink (or changed copy).

• count-note-beats_mu͒*.qml

  Write beats atop every note.
  Implemented by request from Phillip Duke in the 2020-09-23 MuseScore Café.
  Backported to MuseScore 2 for Jinx from #MuseScore on IRC ☺

• export-location-info-phys.qml

  Prototype, not yet ready for public consumption.

  Ask user for a directory to store a file (score basename + ".locinfo.jsn")
  as JSON into. Unroll repeats, enumerate which playback time corresponds to
  which score position, save that. Format:

  { "measures": Array[measure-info], "time-positions": Array[tp-info] }

  measure-info: Array(timesig-numerator, timesig-denominator)
  tp-info: Array(ts, phys-measure-no, beat-no)
  timesig-numerator: integer
  timesig-denominator: integer
  ts: number (integer or float), seconds into the (unrolled) playback
  phys-measure-no: integer, index into measure-info-list, 0-based
  beat-no: number (integer or float), 1-based

  Concept physical measure number: each numbered measure (start at 0,
  increasing by 1 for each) exactly corresponds to a <Measure> in XML
  ignoring the irregular flag and user measure no adjustment and a
  split measure counts once for each split part, beats starting from
  1 always for each physical measure, section breaks don’t restart.

• notenames-as-lyrics_mu͒*.qml

  Write note names in SPN below each note/chord. Here, as lyrics,
  with the lyrics verse corresponding to the voice number.
  Implemented by request from Mmike (Mario Splivalo) in IRC.

  ‣ https://musescore.org/en/project/name-notes

• notenames-as-stafftext_mu͒*.qml

  Same as notenames-as-lyrics.qml (see above) but as staff text.
  Should work with MuseScore 3.2 as well but if you can, use the
  other implementation, as autoplace is tricky here…

• show-ticks_mu͒*.qml

  Display an alert box with the ticks position of the currently selected
  elements. It uses both the MuseScore 3.3+ selected elements API (also
  in 3.2.3+dfsg2-9 in Debian) and the cursor range selection which is
  assumed to terminate one tick before the next segment begins.
